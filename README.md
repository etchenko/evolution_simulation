# Evolution Simulation
This is an evolution simulator creating as a final project for the Computational Biology course at AIT Budapest during Spring 2022.
# Installation
The only requirements to run this project is to have Python 3.9 on your machine, as well as the matplotlib and pyglet dependencies, which can be installed using pip
'''
pip install pyglet
pip install matplotlib
'''
